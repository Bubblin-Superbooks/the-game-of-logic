I am a-person-to-whom-he-brought-a-kettle-by-mistake.
Or we may choose "he" as 'Middle Term', in which case the Premisses will take the form
He is a-person-whom-I-sent-to-bring-me-a-kitten;
He is a-person-who-brought-me-a-kettle-by-mistake.
The latter form seems best, as the interest of the anecdote clearly depends on HIS stupidity--not on what happened to ME. Let us then make m = "he"; x = "persons whom I sent, &c."; and y = "persons who brought, &c."
Hence, All m are x;
   All m are y.    and the required Diagram is
