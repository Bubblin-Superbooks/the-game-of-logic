  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that is rather important, and by no means easy to understand all in a moment: so please to read this VERY carefully.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The world contains many THINGS (such as \"Buns\", \"Babies\", \"Beetles\". \"Battledores\". &c.); and these Things possess many ATTRIBUTES (such as \"baked\", \"beautiful\", \"black\", \"broken\", &c.: in fact, whatever can be \"attributed to\", that is \"said to belong to\", any Thing, is an Attribute). Whenever we wish to mention a Thing, we use a SUBSTANTIVE: when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use an ADJECTIVE. People have asked the question \"Can a Thing exist without any Attributes belonging to it?\" It is a very puzzling question, and I'm not going to try to answer it: let us turn up our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really wasn't worth noticing. But, if they put it the other way, and ask \"Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to?\", we may say at once \"No: no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey with no one to take care of it!\" You never saw \"beautiful\" floating about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing to BE beautiful, now did you?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole? It is this. You may put \"is\" or \"are\" between names of two THINGS (for example, \"some Pigs are fat Animals\"), or between the names of two ATTRIBUTES (for example, \"pink is light-red\"), and in each case it will make good sense. But, if you put \"is\" or \"are\" between the name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, \"some Pigs are pink\"), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing BE an Attribute? unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking. And the simplest understanding would, I think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out in full, would be \"some Pigs are pink (Pigs)\". And now the word \"are\" makes quite good sense. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition \"some new Cakes are nice\", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the form \"some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)\". Now this contains two 'TERMS'--\"new Cakes\" being one of them, and \"nice (Cakes)\" the other. \"New Cakes,\" being the one we are talking about, is called the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and \"nice (Cakes)\" the 'PREDICATE'. Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of it. The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of \"new Cakes\". Lastly, if you would like to have a definition of</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the word 'PROPOSITION' itself, you may take this:--\"a sentence stating that some, or none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called its 'Predicate'\".</p><p>You will find these seven words--PROPOSITION, ATTRIBUTE, TERM, SUBJECT, PREDICATE, PARTICULAR, UNIVERSAL--charmingly useful, if any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied Logic. Mind you bring all seven words into your answer, and you friend will go away deeply impressed--'a sadder and a wiser man'.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now please to look at the smaller Diagram on the Board, and suppose it to be a cupboard, intended for all the Cakes in the world (it would have to be a good large one, of course). And let us suppose all the new ones to be put into the upper half (marked 'x'), and all the rest (that is, the NOT-new ones into the lower half (marked</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">'x''). Thus the lower half would contain ELDERLY Cakes, AGED Cakes, ANTE-DILUVIAN Cakes--if there are any: I haven't seen many, myself--and so on. Let us also suppose all the nice Cakes to be put into the left-hand half (marked 'y'), and all the rest (that is, the not-nice ones into the right-hand half (marked 'y''). At present, then, we must understand x to mean \"new\", x' \"not-new\", y \"nice\", and y' \"not-nice.\") )</p><p>And now what kind of Cakes would you expect to find in compartment No. 5?</p><p>It is part of the upper half, you see; so that, if it has any Cakes in it, they must be NEW: and it is part of the left-hand half; so that they must be NICE. Hence if there are any Cakes in this compartment, they must have the double 'ATTRIBUTE' \"new and nice\": or, if we use letters, the must be \"x y.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Observe that the letters x, y are written on two of the edges of this compartment. This you will find a very</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">convenient rule for knowing what Attributes belong to the Things in any compartment. Take No. 7, for instance. If there are any Cakes there, they must be \"x' y\", that is, they must be \"not-new and nice.\"</p><p>Now let us make another agreement--that a red counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'OCCUPIED', that is, that there are SOME Cakes in it. (The word 'some,' in Logic, means 'one or more' so that a single Cake in a compartment would be quite enough reason for saying \"there are SOME Cakes here\"). Also let us agree that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'EMPTY', that is that there are NO Cakes in it. In the following Diagrams, I shall put '1' (meaning 'one or more' where you are to put a RED counter, and '0' (meaning 'none' where you are to put a GREY one.) )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As the Subject of our Proposition is to be \"new Cakes\", we are only concerned, at present, with the</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">UPPER half of the cupboard, where all the Cakes have the attribute x, that is, \"new.\"</p><p>Now, fixing our attention on this upper half, suppose we found it marked like this,</p><pre><code>                  -----------\n                 |     |     |\n                 |  1  |     |\n                 |     |     |\n                  -----------</code></pre><p>that is, with a red counter in No. 5. What would this tell us, with regard to the class of \"new Cakes\"?</p><p>Would it not tell us that there are SOME of them in the x y-compartment? That is, that some of them (besides having the Attribute x, which belongs to both compartments have the Attribute y (that is, \"nice\"). This we might express by saying \"some x-Cakes are y-(Cakes)\", or, putting words instead of letters, )</p><p>\"Some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)\",</p>",
  "page-24": "<p>or, in a shorter form,</p><p>\"Some new Cakes are nice\".</p><p>At last we have found out how to represent the first Proposition of this Section. If you have not CLEARLY understood all I have said, go no further, but read it over and over again, till you DO understand it. After that is once mastered, you will find all the rest quite easy.</p><p>It will save a little trouble, in doing the other Propositions, if we agree to leave out the word \"Cakes\" altogether. I find it convenient to call the whole class of Things, for which the cupboard is intended, the 'UNIVERSE.' Thus we might have begun this business by saying \"Let us take a Universe of Cakes.\" (Sounds nice, doesn't it?)</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Of course any other Things would have done just as well as Cakes.

  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Cakes are new.\" This is because \"nice\" and \"not-nice\" make what we call an 'EXHAUSTIVE' division of the class \"new Cakes\": i.e. between them, they EXHAUST the whole class, so that all the new Cakes, that exist, must be found in one or the other of them.</p><p>And now suppose you had to represent, with counters the contradictory to \"no Cakes are new\", which would be \"some Cakes are new\", or, putting letters for words, \"some Cakes are x\", how would you do it?</p><p>This will puzzle you a little, I expect.

  "page-64": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">once\", and \"no x are y\" to mean \"the Attributes x, y are INCOMPATIBLE, so that nothing can have both at once\".</p><p>In such treatises, Propositions have quite different meanings from what they have in our 'Game of Logic', and it will be well to understand exactly what the difference is.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">First take \"some x are y\". Here WE understand \"are\" to mean \"are, as an actual FACT\"--which of course implies that some x-Things EXIST. But THEY (the writers of these other treatises only understand \"are\" to mean \"CAN be\", which does not at all imply that any EXIST. So they mean LESS than we do: our meaning includes theirs (for of course \"some x ARE y\" includes \"some x CAN BE y\"), but theirs does NOT include ours. For example, \"some Welsh hippopotami are heavy\" would be TRUE, according to these writers (since the Attributes \"Welsh\" and \"heavy\" are quite</p>",
  "page-65": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">COMPATIBLE in a hippopotamus), but it would be FALSE in our Game (since there are no Welsh hippopotami to BE heavy). )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Secondly, take \"no x are y\". Here WE only understand \"are\" to mean \"are, as an actual FACT\"--which does not at all imply that no x CAN be y. But THEY understand the Proposition to mean, not only that none ARE y, but that none CAN POSSIBLY be y. So they mean more than we do: their meaning includes ours (for of course \"no x CAN be y\" includes \"no x ARE y\"), but ours does NOT include theirs. For example, \"no Policemen are eight feet high\" would be TRUE in our Game (since, as an actual fact, no such splendid specimens are ever found), but it would be FALSE, according to these writers (since the Attributes \"belonging to the Police Force\" and \"eight feet high\" are quite COMPATIBLE: there is nothing to PREVENT a Policeman from growing to that height, if sufficiently</p>",

Here, of course, the treatises mean LESS than we do in the FIRST part, and more than we do in the SECOND. But the two operations don't balance each other--any more than you can console a man, for having knocked down one of his chimneys, by giving him an extra door-step.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If you meet with Syllogisms of this kind, you may work them, quite easily, by the system I have given you: you have only to make 'are' mean 'are CAPABLE of being', and all will go smoothly.

  "page-67": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">will become \"no x are capable of being y\", that is, \"the Attributes x, y are INCOMPATIBLE\". And, of course, \"all x are y\" will become \"some x are capable of being y, and none are capable of being y'\", that is, \"the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE, and the Attributes x, y' are INCOMPATIBLE.\" In using the Diagrams for this system, you must understand a red counter to mean \"there may POSSIBLY be something in this compartment,\" and a grey one to mean \"there cannot POSSIBLY be anything in this compartment.\"</p><ol><li>Fallacies.</li></ol><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And so you think, do you, that the chief use of Logic, in real life, is to deduce Conclusions from workable Premisses, and to satisfy yourself that the Conclusions, deduced by other people, are correct?

  "page-68": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">especially, would be a totally different thing, if even a majority of the arguments, that scattered broadcast over the world, were correct! But it is all the other way, I fear. For ONE workable Pair of Premisses (I mean a Pair that lead to a logical Conclusion that you meet with in reading your newspaper or magazine, you will probably find FIVE that lead to no Conclusion at all: and, even when the Premisses ARE workable, for ONE instance, where the writer draws a correct Conclusion, there are probably TEN where he draws an incorrect one. )</p><p>In the first case, you may say \"the PREMISSES are fallacious\": in the second, \"the CONCLUSION is fallacious.\"</p><p>The chief use you will find, in such Logical skill as this Game may teach you, will be in detecting 'FALLACIES' of these two kinds.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The first kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Premisses'--you will detect when, after marking them on the larger</p>",

In this case you would merely remark, with a pitying smile, \"DEFECTIVE Conclusion!\" Suppose, of example, you were to meet with this Syllogism:--</p><pre><code>       \"All unselfish people are generous;\n        No misers are generous.\n             &there4 No misers are unselfish.\"</code></pre><p>the Premisses of which might be thus expressed in letters:--</p>",

You would shake your head mournfully, and would remark \"Defective Conclusion! Poor little chap!\" And perhaps you would ask the young lady behind the counter whether she would let YOU eat the bun, which the little boy had paid for and left behind him: and perhaps SHE would reply \"Sha'n't!\" )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But if, in the above example, the writer had drawn</p>",
  "page-72": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the Conclusion \"All misers are selfish\" (that is, \"All y are x\"), this would be going BEYOND his legitimate rights (since it would assert the EXISTENCE of y, which is not contained in the Premisses), and you would very properly say \"Fallacious Conclusion!\"</p><p>Now, when you read other treatises on Logic, you will meet with various kinds of (so-called 'Fallacies' which are by no means ALWAYS so.

Take my word for it, there's no place for ignorance in THESE times! And all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you're young. One's got no memory afterwards, worth speaking of. A child will learn more in an hour than a grown man in five. So those, that have to learn, must learn when they're young, if ever they're to learn at all.
