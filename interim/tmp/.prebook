Whenever we wish to mention a Thing, we use a SUBSTANTIVE: when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use an ADJECTIVE. People have asked the question \"Can a Thing exist without any Attributes belonging to it?\" It is a very puzzling question, and I'm not going to try to answer it: let us turn up our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really wasn't worth noticing. But, if they put it the other way, and ask \"Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to?\", we may say at once \"No: no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey with no one to take care of it!\" You never saw \"beautiful\" floating about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing to BE beautiful, now did you?"

You may put \"is\" or \"are\" between names of two THINGS (for example, \"some Pigs are fat Animals\"), or between the names of two ATTRIBUTES (for example, \"pink is light-red\"), and in each case it will make good sense. But, if you put \"is\" or \"are\" between the name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, \"some Pigs are pink\"), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing BE an Attribute? unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking. And the simplest understanding would, I think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out in full, would be \"some Pigs are pink (Pigs)\".

Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of it. The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of \"new Cakes\". Lastly, if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION' itself, you may take this:--\"a sentence stating that some, or none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called its 'Predicate'\"."

Take my word for it, there's no place for ignorance in THESE times! And all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you're young. One's got no memory afterwards, worth speaking of. A child will learn more in an hour than a grown man in five. So those, that have to learn, must learn when they're young, if ever they're to learn at all. Of course that doesn't do unless children are HEALTHY: I quite allow THAT. Well, the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless they've got a good colour in their cheeks. And only just look at my darlings! Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies! Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week. And that's EXACTLY our plan I can assure you! We never go beyond six hours, and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner! So how you can imagine I'm running any risk in the education of my precious pets is more than I can understand, I promise you!\""
