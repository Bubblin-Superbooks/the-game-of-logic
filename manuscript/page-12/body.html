<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">night,
By which to read in very deed
   Thy spirit, sweetest friend!
So may the stream of Life's long dream
Flow gently onward to its end,
   With many a floweret gay,
   Adown its willowy way:
May no sigh vex, no care perplex,
   My loving little friend!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
